This is a really simple supybot plugin, designed specifically to be used at #fedora*

The idea is that, a user can message fedora-ops without actually entering -ops, simply from any of the channels
that Fedbot resides in at that point in time.

Installation

1) place this folder (Fedops) in your plugin directory
2) pm the bot, and type "load Fedops" - the bot should respond positivley

Usage

Simply call @ops from any channel that Fedbot is currently in, the result will be a message
to #fedora-ops details the reporter and the channel they are currently in
